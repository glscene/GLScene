GLScene for Win32/Win64
Embarcadero Rad Studio 11.0

-------------------------------------------------------

GLScene is an OpenGL based 3D library for Delphi, C++Builder and Lazarus. 
It provides visual components and objects allowing description and effective rendering of 3D scenes.
GLScene is not only an OpenGL wrapper or utility library, but it has grown to become a set of founding classes 
for a generic 3D engine with Rapid Application Development in mind. 
GLScene allows you to quickly design and render 3D scenes without having to learn the intricacies of OpenGL: 
if you know how to design a TForm, you'll easily master the basic operation of TGLScene. 
Make sure to checkout the introduction tutorial included in the help folder.
GLScene includes more than many components and a variety of founding classes. 
The library comes with a comfortable set of demos showcasing the ease of use and demonstrating RAD wasn't done 
at the expense of CPU horsepower. Advanced demos and samples can be found in the project repository 
at http://sourceforge/projects/glscene/
The GLScene Sound System allows positional 3D audio via low-level APIs like 
FMOD, BASS, OpenAL and WaveOut.

---------------------------------------------------------

To Install GLScene follow the instruction in installation directory. 
To compile GLScene see Installation instruction and after having installed all the necessary units 
and updated your environment library paths open and install the packages appropriate to the corresponding directory. 
Check your RAD Studio paths for duplicates or old .pas/.dcu that's where the problem lies 99% of the time.
If you have installed a current version, make sure no files of the previous version remains, 
some files may have been renamed, moved or removed in between versions with CleanForRelease.bat. 
 
Compile options (activated/deactivated in GLScene.inc, all are inactive by default):
The option DEFINE GLS_Graphics32_SUPPORT  controls support and dependency to Alex Denissov's Graphics32 library 
(http://www.graphics32.org), once activated in GLScene.inc, TGLBitmap32 will redirect 
assignments from TBitmap32.

See http://www.glscene.org for more details.
