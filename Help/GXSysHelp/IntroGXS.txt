GLXEngine is an OpenGL based 3D library for Delphi and C++Builder. 
It provides visual components and objects allowing description and effective rendering of 3D scenes.
GLXEngine is not only an OpenGL wrapper or utility library, but it's grown to become a set of founding classes 
for a generic 3D engine for the Rapid Application Development. 
GLXEngine allows you to design and render 3D scenes quickly and without having to learn the intricacies of OpenGL: 
if you know how to design a TForm, you'll easily master the basic operation of TgxScene. 
Make sure to checkout the introduction tutorial included in the help folder.
GLXEngine includes more than many components and a variety of founding classes. 
The library comes with a comfortable set of demos showcasing the ease of use and demonstrating RAD wasn't done 
at the expense of CPU horsepower. 
The GLXEngine Sound System allows positional 3D audio via low-level APIs like 
FMOD, BASS, OpenAL and WaveOut.
Advanced demos and samples could be found in the project directory GLXEngine\Examples.
Some additional options for compiler are in GLScene.Defines.inc (activated/deactivated, all are inactive by default):
The option DEFINE Graphics32_SUPPORT controls support Alex Denissov's Graphics32 library 
(http://www.graphics32.org), once activated will redirect assignments from TBitmap32 to TGLBitmap32.
